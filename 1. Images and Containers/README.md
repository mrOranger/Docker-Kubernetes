# Images and Containers

Let's dive now in the first chapter of this repository, where we will talk about **Images** and **Containers**. Both of these are the fundamental blocks of a Docker application, to explain briefly them we can use a programming example: while Images are the source code of our application, Containers are the compiled code generated by Images.

## Images

Containers are the basic executable unit, through out which can run our application. Building a Container requires a set of instructions, to create the basic environment and deploy our source code. The set of instructions used to create the container is defined in an Image.

Therefore, Images are blueprints through we can create different containers, as we can see from this figure:

<div style="width: 100%">
    <img src="../assets/1. Images and Containers/Images.png" alt="Image" />
</div>

There are different ways to create a Container using an image. However, easiest way is to get an existing image from the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), the official repository of Docker where you can define any image for your needs.

Moreover, running this command:

```bash
docker run node
```

Docker Engine will automatically download and run a container using an Image named "node" inside the Docker Hub. Moreover, running this command, you will probably notice that the first output message indicates that the Docker is unable to get the image locally, and then is going to pull the image from the remote repository.

Once the download will be completed, and the Container has been created, we can check the running container using the command:

```shell
docker ps -a
```

where `ps` stands for "processes" and `-a` stands for "all". That is: "show me all the running processes, therefore all the running containers, with their settings".

The "node" image that we download, is not configured to run in background, because is nothing more than a standalone node engine, where we can only run command in the shell. However, we can interact directly to our container by using the command:

```shell
docker run node -it
```

where the flag `-it`, indicates that we are going to run the command interactively. Finally, the node shell will be attached to our shell, and we can use any javascript and node instructions.
